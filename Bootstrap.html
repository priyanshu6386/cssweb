          <b>What is Bootstrap?</b>  

Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. 
It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, 
mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). 
All thanks to Bootstrap developers – Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.
