    HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. 
    Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, 
    each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.

    HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. 
    But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
    Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features,
     which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
    Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML,
     giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages.
    But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
    Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, 
    which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.

    Features of HTML: 

    It is easy to learn and easy to use.

    It is platform-independent.

    Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.

    Hypertext can be added to the text.

    It is a markup language.


   <b> Why learn HTML? </b> 
    
    It is a simple markup language. Its implementation is easy.
    It is used to create a website.
    Helps in developing fundamentals about web programming.
    Boost professional career.
    Advantages: 
    
    HTML is used to build websites.
    It is supported by all browsers.
    It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc.
    Disadvantages: 
    
    HTML can only create static web pages. For dynamic web pages, other languages have to be used.
    A large amount of code has to be written to create a simple web page.
    The security feature is not good.
